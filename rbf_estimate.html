Error bound for radial basis interpolation in terms of a growth function, in&nbsp; "Curve and Surface Fitting: Avignon 2006," 
(A.~Cohen, J.-L.~Merrien and L.~L.~Schumaker, Eds.), pp.~121--130, 
Nashboro Press, Brentwood, 2007.
   
<p><b>Abstract:</b> We suggest an improvement of 
Wu-Schaback local error bound for radial basis interpolation by
using a polynomial growth function. The new bound is valid
without any assumptions about the density of the interpolation centers. 
It can be useful for the localized methods of scattered data fitting and 
for the meshless discretization of partial differential equations.
