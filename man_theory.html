<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
We present methods for either interpolating data or for fitting
scattered data 
on a two-dimensional smooth manifold $\Omega$. The methods are based on a 
local bivariate Powell-Sabin interpolation
scheme, and make use of a family of charts
$\{(U_\xi,\phi_\xi)\}_{\xi\in\Omega}$ satisfying certain
conditions of smooth dependence on $\xi$. If $\Omega$ is 
a $C^2$-manifold embedded
into $\RR^3$, then projections
into tangent planes can be employed.  The data fitting method is a two-stage method.
We prove that the resulting function on the manifold is continuously 
differentiable,
and establish error bounds for both methods 
for the case when the data are generated by
a smooth function.
