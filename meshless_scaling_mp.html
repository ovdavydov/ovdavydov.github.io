<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
We study the behaviour of the optimal shape parameter for the meshless Gaussian RBF-FD method with multipoint 
stencils on irregular centres for Poisson equations with smooth solution. Numerical experiments
show that its value does not
depend significantly  on the density of the centres. Therefore an algorithm based on comparison of
RBF solutions on two nested sets of centres effectively computes a near-optimal shape parameter and 
helps to obtain more accurate solutions of the PDE than those computed by linear finite elements
on the same discretisation centres and with comparable density/bandwidth of the system matrix.
