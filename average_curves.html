<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
Fibre tractography using diffusion tensor imaging is a promising method for estimating the pathways of
white matter tracts in the human brain. The success of fibre tracking methods ultimately depends upon the
accuracy of the fibre tracking algorithms and the quality of the data. Uncertainty and its representation have an
important role to play in fibre tractography methods to infer useful information from real world noisy diffusion
weighted data. Probabilistic fibre tracking approaches have received considerable interest recently for resolving
orientational uncertainties. In this study, an average curves approach was used to investigate the impact of SNR
and tensor field geometry on the accuracy of three different types of probabilistic tracking algorithms. The
accuracy was assessed using simulated data and a range of tract geometries. The average curves representations
were employed to represent the optimal fibre path of probabilistic tracking curves. The results are compared with
streamline tracking on both simulated and in vivo data.
