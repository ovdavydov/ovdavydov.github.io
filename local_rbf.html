<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper we continue our earlier research [4] aimed at developing
efficient methods of local approximation suitable for the first stage of
a spline based two-stage scattered data fitting algorithm. 
As an improvement to the pure polynomial local approximation method used
in [5], 
a hybrid polynomial/radial basis scheme was 
considered in [4], where the local knot locations  for the 
RBF terms were selected using a greedy knot insertion algorithm. 
In this paper standard radial
local approximations based on interpolation or least squares 
 are considered and a faster procedure is used for 
knot selection, significantly reducing the computational cost of the method.
Error analysis of the method and  numerical results illustrating
its performance are given.
