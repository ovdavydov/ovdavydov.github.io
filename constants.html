<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
We show that the saturation order of piecewise constant approximation in $L_p$ norm
on convex partitions with $N$ cells is $N^{-2/(d+1)}$, where $d$ is the number of variables. This order is achieved
for any $f\in W^2_p(\Omega)$ on a partition obtained by a simple algorithm involving an anisotropic
subdivision of a uniform partition. This improves considerably  the approximation order  $N^{-1/d}$
achievable on isotropic partitions. In addition we show that the saturation order of piecewise linear 
approximation on convex partitions is  $N^{-2/d}$, the same as on isotropic partitions.
