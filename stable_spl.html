<p><b>Abstract:</b> We present error bounds for the approximation from the spaces of multivariate
piecewise polynomials admitting stable local bases. In particular, the bounds apply to the spaces
of smooth finite elements in n variables. In addition, in the case of a space of bivariate quintic C1
piecewise polynomials we discuss its stable splitting into a subspace satisfying homogeneous boundary
conditions and its complement. These results are used by K. Böhmer [3] in his finite element method
for general fully nonlinear elliptic differential equations of second order.
