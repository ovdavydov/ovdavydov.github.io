<b>O. Davydov</b>,
On the approximation power of local least squares polynomials, in&nbsp;
"Algorithms for Approximation IV," (J.Levesley, I.J.Anderson and J.C.Mason,
Eds.), pp.346-353, University of Huddersfield, UK, 2002.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> We discuss the relationship between the norm of the
local discrete least squares polynomial approximation operator, the minimal
singular value $\sigmam(P_\Xi)$ of the matrix $P_\Xi$ of the evaluations
of the basis polynomials, and the norming constant of the set of data points
$\Xi$ with respect to the space of polynomials. Since these three quantities
are equivalent up to bounded constants, and since $\sigmam(P_\Xi)$ can
be efficiently computed, it is feasible to use $\sigmam(P_\Xi)$ as a tool
for distinguishing good local point constellations, which is useful for
scattered data fitting. In addition, we give a simple new proof of a bound
by Reimer for the norm of the interpolation operators on the sphere and
extend it to discrete least squares operators.
