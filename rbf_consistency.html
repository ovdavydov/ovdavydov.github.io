<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
The literature on 
meshless methods observed that kernel-based numerical differentiation 
formulae are robust and
provide high accuracy at low cost. This paper analyzes the error of such
formulas, using the new technique of growth functions. It allows to bypass
certain technical assumptions that were needed to prove the standard error
bounds on interpolants and their derivatives. 
Since differentiation formulas based on polynomials
also have error bounds in terms of growth functions, we have a convenient way
to compare kernel-based and polynomial-based formulas. It 
follows that kernel-based formulas are comparable in 
accuracy to the best possible polynomial-based 
formulas. A variety of examples is provided.
