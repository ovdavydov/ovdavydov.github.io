<b>O. Davydov</b>, On almost interpolation, <i>J.
Approx. Theory</i> <b>91</b> (1997), 398-418.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> We obtain some characterizations of almost interpolation
configurations of points with respect to finite-dimensional functional
spaces. Particularly, a Schoenberg-Whitney type characterization which
is valid for any multivariate spline space relative to an arbitrary partition
of a domain $A\subset\RR^m$ is presented. As a closely related problem
we investigate sectional structure of finite-dimensional spaces of real
functions on a topological space $A$. It is shown that under some reasonable
restrictions on $A$ any space of this sort may be considered as piecewise
almost Chebyshev.
