<b>O. Davydov,

independent bases, <i>East J. Approx.</i> <b>5</b> (1999), 67-88.
<p><b>Abstract:</b> A characterization of almost interpolation configurations
of points in terms of supports of basis functions is presented. Moreover,
we show that this characterization can be significantly simplified in the
case of existence of a locally linearly independent basis, so that almost
interpolation sets can be constructed by taking a point in a support of
each basis function. Some further results, including several equivalent
definitions of a locally linearly independent system of functions, are
given.
