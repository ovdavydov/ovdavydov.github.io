<p><b>Abstract:</b> We present an algorithm of local refinement of finite-element
and spline approximations based on a uniform refinement of the mesh. Since
a local mesh refinement is not needed, the method is in particular applicable
to low order smooth polynomial splines on uniform type triangulations,
tensor product and box splines as well as some smooth composite finite
elements. The algorithm can be used in the context of adaptive approximation
methods.
