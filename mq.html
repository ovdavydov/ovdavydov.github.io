<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
While it was noted by R. Hardy and proved in a famous paper by C. A. Micchelli that radial basis 
function interpolants $s(x)=\sum\lambda_j\phi(\|x-\x_j\|)$ exist uniquely for
the multiquadric radial function $\phi(r)=\sqrt{r^2+c^2}$ as soon as
the (at least two) centres are pairwise distinct, the error bounds for this
interpolation problem always demanded an added constant to $s$. 
By using Pontryagin native spaces, we obtain error bounds that 
 no longer require this additional constant expression.
