<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
This paper presents a novel approach for improved diffusion tensor fibre tractography, aiming to
tackle a number of the limitations of current fibre tracking algorithms, and describes a
quantitative analysis tool for probabilistic tracking algorithms. We consider the sampled random
paths generated by a probabilistic tractography algorithm from a seed point as a set of curves, and
develop a statistical framework for analysing the curve-set geometrically that finds the average
curve and dispersion measures of the curve-set statistically. This study is motivated firstly by the
goal of developing a robust fibre tracking algorithm, combining the power of both deterministic and
probabilistic tracking methods using average curves. These typical curves produce strong connections
to every anatomically distinct fibre tract from a seed point and also convey important information
about the underlying probability distribution. These single well-defined trajectories overcome a
number of the limitations of deterministic and probabilistic approaches. A new clustering algorithm
for branching curves is employed to separate fibres into branches before applying the averaging
methods. Secondly, a quantitative analysis tool for probabilistic tracking methods is introduced
using statistical measures of curve-sets. Results on phantom and in vivo data confirm the efficiency
and effectiveness of the proposed approach for the tracking algorithm and the quantitative analysis
of the probabilistic methods.
