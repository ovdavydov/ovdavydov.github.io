Version 1.00, released 18 June 2012.

Changes from version 0.91:

	* The code made C++ compliant by slight modifications in src/SpC2d6D2.h, src/SpC2d6D2.c
	  and adding extern"C" to the declarations of FORTRAN functions of BLAS/LAPACK in linalg.c
		To compile with g++ simply choose CC = g++ in init.mk
	* The code made ISO C89 compliant by removing variable-size arrays in locrbf.c
	  and linalg.c
  * Installation notes for Windows Visual Studio C++ 2010 added (see INSTALL)
	* Reference to a non-ISO header file values.h removed and macros MAXDOUBLE 
	  defined explicitely
	* A bug fixed in function 'compute_rbf_loc_appr' in locrbf.c. In the rare case
	  when rest_dim had the value 0, the program was exiting with a failure giving 
	  an error message related to the BLAS routine DGEMM.
	* Linking to g2c in lapack.mk removed as it is not anymore required by the newer versions 
	  of the gcc compiler
	* Support for CLAPACK dropped.
