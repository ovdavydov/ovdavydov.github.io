Richard Franke's test data can now be downloaded from this site in the 
same way as described below in this file.

For example, for the MATLAB code of the famous Franke Test Function, open

http://www.tsfit.de/Franke_test_data/sdprog/f1.m 


As another example, the following file contains the 100 point data set 
used in the report 
R. Franke, A critical comparison of some methods for interpolation of 
scattered data, Report NPS-53-79-003, Naval Postgraduate School, 1979.

as well as anonymous ftp mentioned below may not be available anymore.

This file is a copy of the README file on anonymous ftp under
ftp/pub/franke, except for this added prelude.  To look at the
files I have available in sddata and sdprog subdirectories, see
the list below.  To look at any of those files using your browser
here, just open, for example, the file

http://www.math.nps.navy.mil/~rfranke/sdprog/f1.m

If you have trouble accessing anything you need (or want), send
me an email with the problem.

I intend to have various things in here, eventually.  For now there
are two subdirectories:  sddata and sdprog

Data files in pub/franke/sddata
               .m denotes a matlab m-file, some are functions,
                  some are "open" programs.
