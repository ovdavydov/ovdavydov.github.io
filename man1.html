<p><b>Abstract:</b> We present C1 methods for either interpolating data or for
tting scattered data associated with a smooth function on a two-dimensional
smooth manifold embedded into R3. The methods are based
on a local bivariate Powell-Sabin interpolation scheme and make use of
local projections on the tangent planes. The data tting method is a
two-stage method. We illustrate the performance of the algorithms with
some numerical examples, which, in particular, conrm the O(h3) order
of convergence as the data becomes dense.
