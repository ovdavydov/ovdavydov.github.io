<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
A Bernstein-Bézier basis is developed for $\b{H}(\Div)$-conforming finite
elements that gives a clear separation between the \emph{curls} of the Bernstein
basis for the polynomial discretisation of the space $H^1$, and the non-curls
that characterize the specific $\b{H}(\Div)$ finite element space
(Raviart-Thomas in our case). The resulting basis has two distinct components
reflecting this separation with the basis functions in each component having a
natural identification with a domain point, or node, on the element. It is shown
that the basis retains the favourable properties of the Bernstein basis that
were used in [1] to develop
efficient computational procedures for the application of the elements.
