<p><b>Abstract:</b> We develop an algorithm for constructing Lagrange and
Hermite interpolation sets for spaces of cubic $C^1$-splines on general
classes of triangulations built up of nested polygons whose vertices are
connected by line segments. Additional assumptions on the triangulation
are significantly reduced compared to the special class given in [4]. Simultaneously,
we have to determine the dimension of these spaces, which is not known
in general. We also discuss the numerical aspects of the method.
