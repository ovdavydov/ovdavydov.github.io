<p><b>Abstract:</b> We suggest a local hybrid approximation scheme based on 
polynomials
and radial basis functions, and use it to improve  the scattered data
fitting algorithm of [7]. Similar to that algorithm,
the new method has  linear
computational complexity and is therefore suitable for large real world data.
Numerical examples suggest that it can produce high quality artefact-free
approximations that are
more accurate  than those given by the original method where
pure polynomial local approximations are used.
