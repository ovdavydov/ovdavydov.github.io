<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
This paper presents a novel white matter fibre tractography approach using average curves of probabilistic fibre
tracking measures. We compute "representative" curves from the original probabilistic curve-set using two
different averaging methods. These typical curves overcome a number of the limitations of deterministic and
probabilistic approaches. They produce strong connections to every anatomically distinct fibre tract from a seed
point and also convey important information about the underlying probability distribution. A new clustering
algorithm is employed to separate fibres into branches before applying averaging methods. The performance of the
technique is verified on a wide range of seed points using a phantom dataset and an in vivo dataset.
